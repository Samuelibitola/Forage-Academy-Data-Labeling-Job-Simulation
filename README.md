# Forage Academy – Data Labeling Job Simulation (Nov 2025)

This repository contains my completed work from the Forage Academy Data Labeling Job Simulation, where I worked as a Data Labeling Analyst for a hypothetical AI company. The simulation focused on labeling customer support messages to help train reliable, privacy-safe AI systems.

## 🚀 Overview

During this simulation, I applied structured labels to real-world support messages using a consistent schema:

- Intent (Billing, Technical, Account, Other)

- Sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)

- PII Flagging (identifying personal information without storing it)

I also completed a reviewer module where I evaluated work done by other labelers using a Keep / Fix / Flag quality control system.

## 📌 What I Completed in This Project
### ✔ Task 1 — Batch Labeling & PII Awareness

 1. Labeled messages for intent, sentiment, and PII

 2. Identified tricky “edge cases”

 3. Wrote short rationales explaining my decisions

 4. Practiced safe handling of personally identifiable information

### ✔ Task 2 — Review & Quality Control

 1. Reviewed label sets created by another labeler

2. Used the Keep / Fix / Flag methodology

3. Identified inconsistencies and corrected errors

4. Proposed one improvement to the team’s One-Page Guideline

## 🧠 Skills Developed

- Data Labeling & Annotation

- Intent Classification

- Sentiment Analysis

- PII Detection & Privacy Awareness

- Quality Review (QC) of Dataset Labels

- Human–AI Collaboration Skills

- Following and Improving Labeling Guidelines

- Clear, concise reasoning for ambiguous cases

## 📎 About the Simulation

This job simulation was created by Forage Academy to teach foundational skills needed in:

 1. AI Operations

 2. Trust & Safety

 3. Machine Learning Support

 4. Data Annotation / Labeling

It mimics real workflows used inside companies building AI models.
