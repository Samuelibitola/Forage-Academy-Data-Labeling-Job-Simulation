# 📄 Included Documentation

This repository includes two official guideline documents from the Forage Academy Data Labeling Job Simulation. These files demonstrate the annotation standards, decision rules, and privacy practices I followed when completing the project.

## 1. One-Page Guidelines v1.0 (Intent, Sentiment, PII)
📄 [One Page Guidelines - Task 1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23754881/One.Page.Guidelines.-.Task.1.pdf)

This document contains the core labeling schema used throughout the simulation. It covers:

 - Intent classification rules (Billing, Technical, Account, Other)

 - Sentiment guidelines (Positive, Neutral, Negative)

 - PII flagging criteria

 - Step-by-step labeling workflow

 - Edge-case rules

 - Examples and counterexamples

 - Rationale-writing instructions

 - Submission format and consistency checklist

I used this guide to ensure consistent, accurate, and ethical annotation when labeling customer support messages.

## 2. PII Quick Card — Data Labeling
[PII Quick Card - Task 1.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23754895/PII.Quick.Card.-.Task.1.pdf)

A compact reference sheet outlining:

 - What counts as personally identifiable information (PII)

 - Sensitive/high-risk PII categories that require escalation

 - Redaction rules

 - Do/Don’t best practices

- Examples of PII vs. non-PII

- Safety triggers for escalation

This card guided my decisions when determining whether to flag messages containing sensitive information and ensured strict privacy compliance.

# 🧩 Why These Documents Matter

These PDFs show the standards and constraints I followed while completing the simulation. They demonstrate:

My ability to work with professional annotation guidelines

Understanding of labeling logic

Experience with PII safety protocols

Familiarity with real industry documentation used by AI Ops, Trust & Safety, and ML data teams

Including them provides context for the labeled datasets and review exercises in this repository.
